# Diablo IV TrackerDiablo IV Tracker

------------

This is a simple java-based app for Diablo IV that gives you timers for events such as:
- Helltides
- Legions
- World Bosses

When an event is active it will highlight the event section in red.

You can make the active events fade from black to red by **Right-Click** > **Settings** > **Enable Active Pulsing**

Currently the window will remain on top of any active windows.
------------
## Installation
To use this app, you must have Java installed and updated to the latest version of Java. Then simply run the .jar file to launch the app.

------------

## Roadmap
Future versions will allow you to set a notification sound for when an event becomes active. You will also be able to disable "Always on Top" if needed.
